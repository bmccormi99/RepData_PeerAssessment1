# Reproducible Research - Peer Assessment 1

## Github submission for this assignment.  Below is the introduction to the assignment and an overview of the dataset.

#### PA1_template.md - The main submission output for this assignment.  This file can be viewed directly within the github website.  This is where peer evaluators should go next.
#### Plots - The plots are shown within the document, but they can also be found in the /figure/ folder on Github
#### PA1_template.html - output of the knit2html() process but is not viewed directly in Github, be sure you are viewing the correct fle.
#### PA1_template.Rmd - source file which is passed to knit2html() to produce the above files.
#### Activity.csv - unzipped version of the activity.zip (supplied) file described below


## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
[Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.


## Assignment

This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to
write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately,
you will need to complete the entire assignment in a **single R
markdown** document that can be processed by **knitr** and be
transformed into an HTML file.

## Submitting the Assignment

To submit the assignment:

1. Commit your completed `PA1_template.Rmd` file to the `master` branch of your git repository (you should already be on the `master` branch unless you created new ones)

2. Commit your `PA1_template.md` and `PA1_template.html` files produced by processing your R markdown file with the `knit2html()` function in R (from the **knitr** package)

3. If your document has figures included (it should) then they should have been placed in the `figure/` directory by default (unless you overrode the default). Add and commit the `figure/` directory to your git repository.
